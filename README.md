<h2>Motivation</h2>
Worked a previous project where the program can read jpeg's metadata. I was inspired to create a Java library that could edit a jpeg's exchange information and uploaded to Github as reference or possible Java library for others.

<h2>Issues</h2>
Editing the GPS tags results in an "unknown tag" discrepancy but the editing does succeed
